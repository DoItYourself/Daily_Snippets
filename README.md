# Daily_Snippets
The Daily Snippets tool allows a user to enter daily useful, meaningful, and inspiring messages about their experiences and keep it for future reference in a database. 
It is basically an online journal. 
Daily Snippets will be able to take in voice entries, give the user the ability to edit the entries, and then insert that into the database in the future. Future capabilities also include the ability to open the program by voice and maybe through the command line.  
The database will record the time, day, message category, and message.
The tool will use a user interface to solicit critical, positive messages.
The tool will automagically execute at a user-defined time, say at the end or beginning of their day so they do not have to open it manually.
